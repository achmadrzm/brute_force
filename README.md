# Brute Force Password Cracker

This repository contains a Python script that implements a brute force method to generate and try all possible combinations of characters to crack a password. It uses the `itertools.product` function to generate combinations from a set of characters, including lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## How It Works
The script generates password combinations of varying lengths (from 1 to 10 characters) and prints each attempt along with its count.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brute_force.git
